# DeepLearning

This repository contains code from the book "Dive into Deep Learning". Implemented with PyTorch.

1. _Data Manipulation_ - store and manipulate data.
2. _Data Preprocessing_ - to apply deep learning to solving real-world problems, begin with preprocessing raw data.
3. _Linear Algebra_ - introduce the basic mathematical objects, arithmetic, and operations, expressing each of them through the corresponding implementation in code.
4. _Calculus_ - calculation of derivatives, differentiation, partial rerivatives, gradients etc.
5. _Automatic Differentiation_ - the system builds a computational graph, tracking which data combined through which operations to produce the output.
6. _Probability_ - machine learning is all about making predictions, we need to think about the probability of getting a high reward under each of the available actions.
7. _Documentation_ - guidance to exploring the PyTorch API.
